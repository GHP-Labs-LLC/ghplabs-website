        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 4, 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Imagine That! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Imagine That mobile

        <h2>5. AI-Generated Content</h2>

        <p>Imagine That uses artificial intelligence to generate stories, illustrations, and narration. While we employ

            <li>AI-generated content may occasionally contain errors or unexpected output</li>
            <li>We recommend parental review of generated stories, especially for younger children</li>
            <li>Generated stories are for personal, non-commercial entertainment</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee that all generated content will be suitable for all ages</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Content Safety</h2>

        <p>We employ content safety filters on all generated text and images. Prompts that attempt to generate violent,
            sexual, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate content will be blocked. If you encounter content you believe is
            inappropriate, please report it to us immediately.</p>

            <li>Attempt to bypass content safety filters</li>
            <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to our systems or other users' accounts</li>
