        <p class="app-name">Imagine That</p>
        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 4, 2026</p>

        <p>GHP Labs LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates Imagine That, an AI-powered storytelling application for
            children and families. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your
            information when you use our mobile application and related services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and
            authentication credentials (such as Sign in with Apple or Google Sign-In tokens). Your account is managed
            through GHP Labs' shared authentication system, which means the same account may be used across other GHP
            Labs applications (such as ClipCook and Sorted). While your account identity is shared, each app's
            data remains separate — your Imagine That stories and preferences are not accessible to other GHP Labs
            apps.</p>

        <p><strong>Story Data:</strong> We collect and store stories created through the app, including text prompts,
            generated narratives, AI-generated illustrations, and voice narration preferences.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with Imagine That, including
            features used, stories created, and preferences selected.</p>

        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device identifiers, operating system version, and push
            notification tokens to deliver notifications.</p>

        <p><strong>Voice Input:</strong> If you use voice features, audio is processed in real-time to generate text
            prompts. We do not store raw audio recordings.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve Imagine That's features and services</li>
            <li>Generate AI-powered stories and illustrations based on your prompts</li>
            <li>Provide text-to-speech narration of stories</li>
            <li>Save and organize your story library</li>
            <li>Apply content safety filters to ensure age-appropriate output</li>
            <li>Respond to your requests and provide customer support</li>
            <li>Analyze usage patterns to improve our services</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Imagine That is designed for use by families.</strong> We expect that a parent or guardian creates
                and manages the account. Children should use the app under parental supervision.</p>
        </div>

        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information directly from children under 13 without parental consent. All
            account creation requires an adult. If you believe a child under 13 has provided us personal information
            without parental consent, please contact us and we will promptly delete it.</p>

        <p>All AI-generated content passes through safety filters designed to ensure stories and illustrations are
            age-appropriate.</p>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services that help us operate Imagine That, including
                cloud hosting (Supabase), AI processing (Google), text-to-speech services, and push notification
                delivery (Apple).</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law or to protect our rights and the safety of our
                users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Content Safety</h2>

        <p>All stories and illustrations generated by Imagine That are filtered for age-appropriate content. We use
            AI-powered safety systems to prevent the generation of violent, inappropriate, or harmful content. Story
            prompts that attempt to generate unsafe content are blocked.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, including
            encryption of data in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100%
            secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You
            may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us. Upon account
            deletion, all your stories and personal data will be permanently removed from our systems.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>

        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your information</li>
            <li>Download a copy of your data</li>
            <li>Opt-out of certain data processing activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date.</p>
