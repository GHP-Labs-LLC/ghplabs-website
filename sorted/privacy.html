        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 4, 2026</p>

        <p>GHP Labs LLC ("we," "our," or "us") operates Sorted, an AI-powered style assistant application. This Privacy
            Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile
            application and related services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your name, email address, and
            authentication credentials (such as Sign in with Apple or Google Sign-In tokens). Your account is managed
            through GHP Labs' shared authentication system, which means the same account may be used across other GHP
            Labs applications (such as ClipCook and Imagine That). While your account identity is shared, each app's
            data remains separate — your Sorted wardrobe and style data are not accessible to other GHP Labs apps.</p>

        <p><strong>Photos and Images:</strong> We collect and store photos you upload of your outfits, clothing items,
            and wardrobe. These images are used to provide personalized style recommendations.</p>

        <p><strong>Style Preferences:</strong> We collect information about your style preferences, including favorite
            colors, preferred styles, body measurements (if provided), and outfit ratings.</p>

        <p><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We collect information about how you interact with Sorted, including features
            used, outfits created, and recommendations viewed.</p>

        <p><strong>Device Information:</strong> We collect device identifiers, operating system version, and push
            notification tokens to deliver notifications about your style recommendations.</p>

        <p><strong>Phone Number (Optional):</strong> If you choose to link your phone number to receive SMS
            notifications, we collect and store your phone number.</p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>

                    purposes.</strong> All the above categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and
                consent; this information will not be shared with any third parties.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Message and data rates may apply. You can opt-out at any time by replying STOP to any message or by disabling
            SMS notifications in the app settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Information Sharing</h2>

        <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> Third-party services that help us operate Sorted, including cloud
                hosting (Supabase), AI processing (Google, OpenAI), and push notification delivery (Apple).</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> When required by law or to protect our rights and the safety of our
                users.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Photo Privacy</h2>

        <p>Your photos are private by default. We do not share your photos with other users or make them publicly
            accessible. Photos are processed by our AI systems solely to provide you with personalized style
            recommendations. You can delete any photo from your wardrobe at any time.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Security</h2>

        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information, including
            encryption of photos in transit and at rest. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100%
            secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

        <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>

        <p>We retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. You
            may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time by contacting us. Upon account
            deletion, all your photos and personal data will be permanently removed from our systems.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>

        <p>Depending on your location, you may have the right to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access the personal information we hold about you</li>
            <li>Request correction of inaccurate information</li>
            <li>Request deletion of your information</li>
            <li>Download a copy of your data</li>
            <li>Opt-out of certain data processing activities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Children's Privacy</h2>

        <p>Sorted is not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information
            from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>

        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new
            Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date.</p>
